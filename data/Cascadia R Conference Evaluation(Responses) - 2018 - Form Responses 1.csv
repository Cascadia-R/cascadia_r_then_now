The databases workshop had logistical and accessibility issues. I couldn't see the text from the middle row, and I think we gave up after asking several times for bigger font. Also, I'm concerned that some of the instructional practices were alienating: the instructor polled the room several times and then commented with things like, ""okay great! oh all of you know this already! i'm glad that everybody knows this already""... except that it was a decently sized crowd, and not everybody raised their hand.
