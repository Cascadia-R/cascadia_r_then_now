6/3/2018 20:39:55,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Visualization,More familiar.,A great deal!,using ggplot2 to graph my own data,Yes,1,A very nice intro to ggplot2. I liked how each section built upon previous knowledge. Definitely the highlight of the conference for me.,I would like more to be covered if possible. It felt a little slow at times. The issue with plotly was a bummer but understandable that those things happen.,PLEASE do a more advanced ggplot2 related workshop next year!

Thank you!,"This is not necessarily about changing anything about the workshops, but the instructors should be aware that it can be disorienting when they quickly scroll through the instructions on the screen or don't leave them up long enough. That was probably my biggest challenge.",See above.

They were patient and helpful,"I think a couple of ""Top 10"" data munging tricks--especially for combining multiple csv's and getting date-times and GPS coordinate data worked out when creating data frames. They can be sticky and frustrating",

I liked that it was beginner because it addressed simple R questions I had straight away (I knew nothing coming in).","After the exercises we kinda just moved on too quickly without addressing the exercise in as much depth as I would've liked. Some examples were ok. But if you can, type out the answer to the question for every example at the end of the exercise, not while people are working.",It was fun!
6/2/2018 12:59:36,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling,More familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,,Maybe,1,You have the workshop rmarkdown available with a corresponding DataCamp so I can practice later - very useful!,"In conference preparatory materials, you could point beginners  to sources beyond ""Getting used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown."" That was extremely helpful to learn the layout of RStudio; however, this workshop also assumes some level of familiarity with the R language and functionality of RStudio that a complete R beginner does not possess. 
I have never used R or written code before, and the beginning of the workshop felt like being dropped into the deep end - and I was struggling  because I didn't understand the basics, and then the topics build on each other. 
You cover a lot of material in this workshop, so it moves pretty fast... and I was able to follow (comprehend) the topics, but didn't have time to actually learn or apply it while I was also working through syntax and format. 
From a brief look, the ModernDive text would be a great thing to link attendees to, and you could be more specific about the base-knowledge level of the workshop.",

Made the whole topic very accessible","I would like more active coding examples/time, or a chance to play with the data/functions. But I think to make that time we would have to shorten the background portion, which was absolutely essential for my learning.",Excellent workshop for me

There were also repeated statements like ""this is very simple"" when I didn't find the concepts simple at all. It was overwhelming and hard for me to follow. There should have been a prerequisite of a machine learning background. Or it should have been much more introductory. Like spend the entire time going through the code example and what it's doing and why it's doing that and what the graphs mean. ",:(
6/2/2018 11:57:17,Intermediate Machine Learning 1,Equally familiar.,None.,There is no way to apply anything from the lecture that was given. Maybe a demo or something would give me something to apply.,No,3,Nothing. Extremely disappointed.,Maybe have someone who appears to know the language and actually have some examples of how to complete the process for whatever the subject is. This was entirely lecture about the basic idea behind the topic. USELESS,

Provide readings beforehand so more time can be spent with hands-on coding and interpreting models. I would also give people access to a VM or docker container before the conference, as people had difficulty with installation.",Q&A at the end was awesome!

I consider myself an intermediate R user who wanted to learn about ML but this was mostly way over my head so I kind of checked out. The answer to ""what is tensor flow"" wasn't answered until way into the talk, but it was referred to a lot before that. 
I don't think the comment about the high salaries that data scientists get (because they are working on things that are ""hard"") was  appropriate. ",

6/2/2018 16:53:56,Intermediate Machine Learning 1,Equally familiar.,None.,,Maybe,3,The speaker was animated and enthusiastic ,Way LESS jargon,This talk was super jargon heavy and moved at a fast pace. Due to the pace / jargon following the talk was very difficult. I thought the speaker was enthusiastic but missed the mark on knowing their audience. How can we follow you when your moving a mile a minute and throwing jargon at us? This talk was not appropriate for a teaching workshop but rather a talk to colleagues.

From a pedagogical standpoint, it was harder for me to understand exactly what the point of the specific function ( dbSendQuery(), dbFetch()) and dbplyr.  

Aaron mentioned how you could get this to interface with a shiny app (eg, dynamically querying your database based on shiny input).  It would've been nice to see an actual shiny app where this was the care and a nice way to see how everything flows together.

I couldn't tell if it was just bad luck or if it would have gone better if he had practiced more. He didn't seem to know what would work or wouldnt' work or where the files he needed were. It was hard to concentrate on what he was saying because there were so many technical problems. There wasn't a good flow to the content.

6/2/2018 19:38:26,Using R with Databases,Equally familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,Not sure yet,Yes,2,It was great to see ways to integrate R and SQL databases. ,"The ""vagrant-situation"" shifted my attention to making it work from the main topic of the workshop. Also, in the instructions, uncareful readers (like me) understood that we would need either Virtual Box or Vagrant, not both - the and/or was a little misleading. ","The instructor showed a good domain knowledge. So sad that the main thing I remember from the talk is that ""now I know how to install and run Vagrant - and it does take a loong time to run""."
6/3/2018 6:14:52,Using R with Databases,More familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,I will use dplyr to access databases more efficiently,Yes,3,Loved the practice problem and the instructor’s tips on the gotchas with using dbplyr!,"Instead of requiring attendees to install VMs and packages on their different systems, provide access to a cloud instance of RStudio, all required packages, and the database (maybe see if Microsoft will donate?), to maximize the time spent on the topic of the workshop.",
6/3/2018 9:03:04,Using R with Databases,Equally familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,will try out the glue package for building SQL query statements,Yes,4,effectively demystified how to run SQL on databases from R and made it realy approachable,have more people using multiple OSes test out virtualbox/vagrant setup process from directions as written before workshop and enhance instructions with their feedback,"I'm not sure how familiar others in the audience were with SQL going into the workshop but since logic of SQL queries weren't really explained, would have been helpful to assign pre-reading and also link to some schema descriptions and data dictionaries for the example"
6/3/2018 11:46:47,Using R with Databases,More familiar.,A great deal!,Shiny inputs feeding into glue for SQL manipulation.,Yes,3,Seeing what tools and library's are being used to work between R and the Database.,Aaron has the technical skills but could have done better with his presentation skills and audience engagement.,
6/5/2018 11:08:24,Using R with Databases,More familiar.,A great deal!,Performance was touched on briefly.  My experience has been that it is better to execute the SQL on the server as opposed to submitting an R generated SQL statement to the server.  The session confirmed my experience.  ,Yes,2,"The virtual machine is a fantastic tool to have in one's toolbox.  Once the virtual machine has been set up, it is a great sandbox for a number of things that I would like to do.  1.  Create a data driven shiny app that pulls configuration information directly out of a database.   The data can be static information like MathJax formulas or dynamic web pages for input prompts for calculations or graphics.   Problem and solution data sets can be stored in the database.  2.  The virtual machine can be used to demo R's capabilities to organizations that have not been expose to R or are a little reluctant to take a look.  

The virtual machine was well worth the price of admission alone.  I was going to install MS-SQL Server on my laptop.  Now I can just use the virtual box.","A step by step illustrated installation document outlining each step, a rough time range for how long each step will take, minimum machine hardware requirements, OS level, and permissions would have eliminated most of the installation issues.  Some users were unfamiliar with them command line. 

Of those that I helped and was successful in getting up were happy.  Most of those that I helped and could not get successfully installed were still appreciative.   Two had windows 7 and another did not have admin rights to the laptop.","The content selection seemed spot on for the subject matter and audience.  For newbie SQL users, the syntax was short enough to get the flavor of how to get the task done.  For experienced users, the SQL was nothing to write home about.       For the newbie, the different joins probably did not make a lot of sense, but would make sense to an experienced SQL user.  

For the experienced SQL user, the parameterization syntax is the key take away of the presentation.  

Most R presentations have a source CSV flat file for the demo.  An application ERD slide would have been useful to drive home the points of a relational DB, the skill set needed to navigate/understand it (join types), and the associated compensation all in one slide.

Aaron, contact me if anything needs clarification -- Sophie."
6/6/2018 11:33:28,Using R with Databases,Equally familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,interacting with databases was a skill that i was hoping to improve,Yes,4,I liked the energy and ambition of the presenter. He clearly knew how to work on databases,"trying to get everyone to install a vagrant image and run it is difficult and time consuming. I would suggest in the future if you want to set up a db, just set one up in an aws or something, and then you can teach us how to connect to a db in the cloud - much more useful and less software for us to install",
6/6/2018 11:35:02,Intermediate Machine Learning 1,More familiar.,A great deal!,,Yes,3,the high level description of a machine learning process,Provide a worked example,
6/2/2018 13:20:41,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling,More familiar.,A great deal!,When trying to sort through datasets or transforming them from longform to short this will definitely help.,Yes,1,I really liked the notes in the markdown file. ,"There were several terns that needed definition or further definition for a beginner like myself (e.g. gather() ""key"")","This conference is a great resource. All of the individuals in my department that are successful with R have attended this confrence. So, this really makes a difference for both faculty and students. "
6/6/2018 11:38:18,Intermediate Machine Learning 1,More familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,,Maybe,3,Paige provided a great high level overview of machine learning.,"I would have liked to see more code examples, but realize that the length of the workshop make that challenging.",
6/6/2018 11:38:41,Using R with Databases,Equally familiar.,None.,,Yes,3,I was excited to see this topic being offered.,"Better communication about the requirements of the workshop, not everyone uses or is used to using Slack, it would have been great if, at a minimum, major announcements were made via email and Slack.",There was some initial confusion and misunderstanding on whether both vagrant and/or virtual box was needed to participate. It seemed a little ardous to have people install additional software when there are easier ways to connect to databases (e.g. url). The presenter did not seem well rehearsed or prepared to run the workshop. There was no clear agenda or learning goal of the workshop.
6/6/2018 11:41:04,Using R with Databases,More familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,,Maybe,3,Links to resources to learn more,The issues around getting up and running with vagrant took much more of the session than it should have. There was also not nearly enough focus on the code as I would have liked.,
6/6/2018 12:02:39,Using R with Databases,More familiar.,A great deal!,I have already talked with others about some ideas using machine learning for work.,Yes,2,"I love the machine learning workshop which covers not only the coding piece, but also the math/algebra behind it, so that I get a good understanding of the blackbox that people usually not talk about. The speaker was a very good teacher that made the concept very easy to understand.",I hope the workshops won't overlap so that I can attend all of them.,
6/2/2018 13:22:34,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling,Equally familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,,Yes,2,systematic introduction of the topic and provide resources to look into in the. future,maybe provide some basic intro for people who has no experience with R to read before the workshop,
6/2/2018 13:56:28,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling,More familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,,Yes,1,the challenge questions,it seemed to cover a lot of ground pretty fast - the intro to what gather and spread were doing could have used a little more time,"fun workshop, thank you!"
6/6/2018 13:15:54,Using R with Databases,Equally familiar.,None.,NA,Maybe,3,Good topic,"Give everyone setup instructions ahead of time, don't try to help people download and install everything during the session. The session got completely derailed by telling people to do a download that takes 15 minutes. 100 people downloading a huge file over public WiFi takes way longer than 15 minutes. Have people set that up before the conference so the session can actually be about learning.",
6/2/2018 18:49:17,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling,More familiar.,A great deal!,,Yes,1,"That we first worked through examples together, and then had opportunities to try to solve new problems ourselves.",It was good as is. ,

Near the end, the speaker did show some examples of work she was doing, but didn't show or explain the code. This was probably a result of not enough time and possibly proprietary work.",
6/6/2018 12:32:44,A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling,More familiar.,Some practical knowledge.,"I know understand how the Spread function works, which is really helpful! I didn't get it before hand. ",Yes,3,"Going through each function, and combining them to get certain results. ","Be more aware of time constraints as to not gloss over the more difficult activities at the end of the workshop. Be more clear about the what attendees should know before joining the workshop; since this workshop is targeted towards novice programmers, some participants were unfamiliar with using R markdown and running code it in. ","Add more workshops, they were great! "

6/7/2018 11:42:31,Using R with Databases,Equally familiar.,None.,I probably won't ,Yes,5,The instructor seemed knowledgeable on the topic.,"I think the instructor knows he crashed and burned, it happens to us all from time to time. I have never seen a workshop run on virtual machines come off well. There always seems to be technical issues. If the image had been made available several days before the workshop it would have allowed the audience to make sure they could get it up and running or troubleshoot any issues.",
6/14/2018 13:50:16,Intermediate Machine Learning 1,More familiar.,A great deal!,I'm still a novice. The sky's the limit. I'd eventually like to be able to apply this in future employment.,Yes,2,There were several illustrative slides in Ms Bailey presentation that put together previous foggy ideas I had in regard to machine learning.,"More hands-on applications similar to the Using R with Databases workshop, although I wouldn't require such a complicated software instillation on the participant's computer..",Looking forward to next year!
6/14/2018 13:57:42,Using R with Databases,More familiar.,None.,Future employment. This particular skill set is in high demand.,Yes,2,I better understand how Postgre and R can be configured in analyzing data. I'll have to spend time on my own to get it to work.,"Many participants experienced great difficulties in installing the required software. On a positive note, I was better able to concentrate on the well-presented material. I think it worked out fine.",Looking forward to next year.
