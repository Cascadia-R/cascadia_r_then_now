Looking at the slides: https://cascadia-r.github.io/cascadia_r_then_now/#/title-slide 

I think the story goes back further than the gigantic beer pub.

It turns out there were lots of strands: Jessica, had we met at Rstudio Conf’s workshop by Jenny Bryan?  

Chester and I met at the Portland R meetup.  For years it had been OHSU-based, but Scott Chamberlain had taken it on and it was thriving.

Chester was doing R support at Reed college.  He contacted Hadley to see if he’d do a talk.  It turned out to  be cheap and easy because “Hadley had family in the area”.  That’s how we heard and possibly met Charlotte. 

The purpose of the conference was to expand the conversation — Get Charlotte and her students to connect, but also bring diverse R users from all over the place together.  Getting people to “see each other” was important.

The Craggy idea was kind of like tidy Tuesday… See how different people visualized the same dataset — and identify lighting talks.  Charlotte’s was one of the lighting talks.

We tried to be transparent all along: what were the ingredients, how were we gathering to learn from each other.  The value of “seeing the community” is that all the different threads can come together: people who may not have recognized each other as partners, all of a sudden had a common purpose.

My 2 cents.
