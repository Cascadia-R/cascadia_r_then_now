## How did we do?

```{r}

responses_likert <- responses |>
  select(contains("Main")) |>
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "category", values_to = "likert") |>
  mutate(category=str_replace(category, "Main Conference Organization", "")) |>
  mutate(category = factor(category))
  
responses_likert |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=likert) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~category)
```

## How did we do?

> Amazing conference! love the one day thing, the schedule, and the location!

> I think the cheap cost and central location really contributed to the crowd size. 

> It would be great to have a keynote about ethics in data science.
