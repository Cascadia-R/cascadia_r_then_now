## How did we do?

> Amazing conference! love the one day thing, the schedule, and the location!

> I think the cheap cost and central location really contributed to the crowd size. 

> It would be great to have a keynote about ethics in data science.


## Cascadia R Users = Amazing!

Conference has continued on and become something even more amazing
