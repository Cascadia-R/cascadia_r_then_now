- Lots of disparate groups: PDX-R, Oregon State University, Seattle-R, Vancouver-R
- beeR discussion: "How can we bring these groups together?"
- Constraints: "How can we make the conference accessible to the most people?"
- Constraints: "Where can we hold it?"

## Diverse in Skill Levels

```

## Diverse in Backgrounds

## How did we do?

> I was seriously blown away. Of all the conferences I've been to over the years this was the most beneficial and well structured conference I've attended. It's an amazing deal that can't be beat!

> Amazing conference! love the one day thing, the schedule, and the location!

> Had a great time and glad I came! Thanks for keeping the coffee flowing.

## How did we do?

> 10/10 for enchantment!                                                                                

> Child care was great!  

> The venue was amazing. The value was exceptional. The conference was very well organized. I loved the code of conduct. I'm having a harder time than expected finding an analytics job and this conference inspired me to keep going, keep learning, keep trying, and keep improving my R skills.


## How did we do?

> I love this conference, it was absolutely a great use of my time  

> y'all did a great job, thank you.

> Please keep doing these conferences. They are valuable

> Thank you so much for making this accessible/affordable to students!

> I'd rate this conference 11/10 and look forward to attending again in future years.

## What Did We Learn? 

- Volunteers are awesome and step up
- A conference is all about the people
- Cascadia R users are amazing

## The Legacy of Cascadia-R

- Brought R users together to talk
- Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
- Workshop material is still being used
- Accessibility is appreciated (cheap tickets, childcare, lactation room)


# What About Now?

Conference has continued on and become something even more amazing

# Pandemic Lessons

## A lifeline

- CascadiaRconf continued virtually
- Maintained a community despite decentralization of information (rip #rstats twitter) and isolation
- Uplifting to be here together again!

## Hybrid/Virtual

- Improve accessibility if done well
- Online networking, sharing of info
- Code of Conduct for both

# Togetherness

> The value of “seeing the community” is that all the different threads can come together: people who may not have recognized each other as partners, all of a sudden had a common purpose.

- John David Smith

# What About The Future?

## Goals

- Get out of Portland (check)
- Keep values upheld (check)
- Encourage participation from all (even a 5 minute talk on something you learned! we are all learners)
- Continue to learn how to increase diversity, accessibility, reach underrepresented groups

## Answers to the Questions

- Can you organize a conference with just 6 people?
  - Hell Yeah!
- Who is the Cascadia-R audience?
  - Talented people who do amazing things
- Should you volunteer for the next Cascadia R?
  - Hell Yeah!
